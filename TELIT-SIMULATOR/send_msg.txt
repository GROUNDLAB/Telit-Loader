1: Set the band
AT#BND=? //which band
AT#BND=2 //set to 2 I think, GMS 850MHz + DCS 1800MHz, or maybe it was 3?

2: Finding the network
AT+COPS=? //lists the networks that are available to you and the one you are on

3: Send a txt msg!
AT+CMGS="+16178003283" //use whatever number you want
press ctrl z to send
Then it will prompt you for the text.

4: read txt msgs you got:
AT+CMGL="ALL"
(other options:
"REC UNREAD" -  new message 
  "REC READ" - read message 
  "STO UNSENT" - stored message not yet sent
